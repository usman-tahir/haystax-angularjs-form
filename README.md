# Haystax AngularJS Registraton Form

### Prerequisites
* `npm`
* Bower package manager (`npm install -g bower`)

### Overview

This application allows the user to register to a certain type of event or services. There is no backend that handles data, but the form can validate information on the client side, and give a confirmation popup modal once the form has been submitted with valid information.

### Usage

To use this application, make sure that `npm` is installed on your machine first, by trying the following command:

`npm --version`

Once that's done, install the Bower dependencies using the following command:

`bower install`

Then, navigate to the `index.html` page locally, to view and use the application.
